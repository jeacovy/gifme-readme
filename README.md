GIFme: Enhancing README Files with Animated GIFs

## Introduction

GIFme is a tool designed to help engineering teams add visual interest to their README files through the use of animated GIFs. The goal is to make README files more engaging, while providing teams with a simple and easy-to-use solution.

## Why GIFme?

Animated GIFs are an excellent way to grab the reader's attention and communicate complex ideas in a simple and fun way. By using GIFme, teams can enhance the overall look and feel of their README files, making them more appealing and user-friendly.

## How to Use GIFme

Using GIFme is straightforward. Simply follow these steps:

- Request a GIPHY API key from the [GIPHY website](https://support.giphy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020283431-Request-A-GIPHY-API-Key).
- Replace `[GIPHY_API_KEY]` in the `.sh` file or add this as an environment variable (be sure to keep your API key secret!).
- Change the `tag` in the `.s`h file or add this as an environment variable to reflect the keyword of the GIF you want to use.
- Enjoy your enhanced README file!

## Use Cases

GIFme is perfect for a variety of use cases, such as pipeline builds, release notes, or any situation where you want to add a little extra flair to your README file. With GIFme, you can easily generate a unique and customized GIF each time you release new code, making your release notes stand out from the rest.

## Notes
